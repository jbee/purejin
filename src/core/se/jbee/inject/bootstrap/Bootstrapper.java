/**
 * The basic idea is to split the binding process into 2 steps: installing
 * modules and do bindings in the installed modules.
 * 
 * Thereby it is possible to keep track of the modules that should be installed
 * before actually install them. This has two major benefits:
 * 
 * 1. it is possible and intentional to declare installation of the same module
 * as often as wanted or needed without actually installing them more then once.
 * This allows to see other modules as needed dependencies or 'parent'-modules.
 * 
 * 2. the installation can be the first step of the verification (in a
 * unit-test). The binding can be omitted so that overall test of a
 * configuration can be very fast.
